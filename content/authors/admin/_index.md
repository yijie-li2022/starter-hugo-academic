I am an undergraduate student at Beijing-Dublin International College (BDIC), BJUT, majoring in Software Engineering. In the past three years, I have completed two papers as the first author and three papers as a second author, two of which have been published recently. I have also developed a simple education-aimed deep learning system, TinyDL and a Python-cuda extension for speeding up tensor operations.

My research interests lie in developing and building computer vision models and algorithms for human face image synthesis, image attribute manipulation, image segmentation, salient object detection, and other related areas.
